## Prepare release

- Create a branch named `prepare-release` to prepare the new release for ODS Android version X.Y.Z.

- Switch to this branch and launch the `prepareRelease` Gradle task:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew prepareRelease -Pversion=X.Y.Z
    ```

    This task performs the following changes to the project:
    
    - Update `version` project property in `gradle.properties`.
    - Update version of ODS Android dependencies in various Markdown files.
    - Update the changelog.
    - Archive the documentation in `docs/X.Y.Z`.
    - Update Jekyll configuration files.<br /><br />

- Verify the changes mentioned above, then commit and push.

    Please see [DEVELOP.md](../DEVELOP.md#documentation) to get more information about how to build and verify the documentation.
    
    Once the Jekyll server is started, the documentation for version X.Y.Z should be available at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ods-android/X.Y.Z/.

- Create a new pull request named `Prepare release X.Y.Z` on GitHub to merge your branch into `develop`.

- Review and merge this pull request on GitHub.<br /><br />

## Release

- Create a new pull request named `Release X.Y.Z` on GitHub to merge `develop` into `main`.

- Review and merge this pull request on GitHub.

- Switch to the latest main commit and launch the `tagRelease` Gradle task:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew tagRelease
    ```

    This task adds an `X.Y.Z` tag and push it to the remote repository.<br /><br />

### Publish release to Maven Central

- Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ods-android/actions) and open the workflow launched by the tag creation.

- Click `Review deployments`, select `maven-central-release` and click `Approve and deploy`.

- Click `Close` if content is OK or `Drop` otherwise.

- Retrieve the Sonatype repository ID from either the repository name or URL.

- Launch the `testSonatypeRepository` Gradle task using the ID from the previous step:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew testSonatypeRepository -PsonatypeRepositoryId=<repository_id>
    ```

    This task allows you to test the release before it is deployed to Maven Central and performs the following changes to the project:
    
    - Add Sonatype Maven repository.
    - Remove all Android Studio modules except `app`.
    - Replace project dependencies with module dependencies in `app`.<br /><br />

- Synchronize Gradle, build app, deploy and test on device.

- Go back to Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager and click `Release`.<br /><br />

### Publish release to GitHub

- Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ods-android/actions), open the release workflow, click `Review deployments`, select `github-release` and click `Approve and deploy`.

- Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ods-android/releases).
